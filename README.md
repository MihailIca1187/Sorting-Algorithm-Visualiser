# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser
Sorting Algorithm Visualiser made in C#

The repo provides a GUI for visualising sorting algorithms. Quite basic, but does the job. 

The currently added sorting algorithms:

- Bubble sort

Planned improvements:

- Multithreading
- More sorting algorithms
- Improving interface
- More algorithms such as searching and path finding
